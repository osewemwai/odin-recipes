    <img src="../images/tilapia.jpeg" alt="Ugali" style="width:500px;height:500px">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a delicacy commonly found within most east african communities</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pieces tilapia</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li> 1 cup cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub salt all over the fish including the insides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a wide frying pan</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot, put-in the tilapia. Cover the frying pan, but make sure to open it a little so that steam can come out. Fry each side in medium heat for about 6 to 10 minutes. Note: I usually wait until I donâ€™t hear any sound. This means that the liquid is gone and the fish is crisp.</li>
        <li>Remove from the pan and arrange in a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Serve with your favorite condiments and side dish.</li>
        <li>Share and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
