    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a delicacy commonly found within most east african communities</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of more water</li>
        <li>2 cups fine corn meal</li>
        <li> ½ -1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Add about 4 cups of water to a heavy large saucepan. Add ½ teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil, remove about a cup and set aside</p></li>
        <li><p>Gradually whisk in the cornmeal, until you have add the whole thing in the pot, a little bit at a time and keep stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent any lumps.You may have to remove saucepan from heat while trying to get rid of lumps- to prevent burns.</p></li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and cook until the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Then add the remaining boiled water, reduce heat, cover, and cook- for about 10 or more. You may add some more water if desired. Turn off the heat. Scoop out balls with a small bowl – shake and form a ball by rolling around a bowl. Or place on a saran wrap plastic (I have been told several times not to do this – health wise so be mindful of it)</li>
    </ol>
